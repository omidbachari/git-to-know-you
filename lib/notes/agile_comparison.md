## Agile Comparison

### *Agile:*
The Agile movement seek alternatives to traditional project management. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

#### _Scrum:_
Scrum breaks down organizations into small, self-organizing teams. These teams then break the features theyâ€™ve been tasked with delivering down into small, manageable items of work which they tackle in time-boxed iterations called sprints. Scrum insists that teams comprise of three distinct roles:
* the Product Owner - main link between Scrum team and customer
* the ScrumMaster - team coach
* dev team members

There are also four prescribed meetings in Scrum:
* the Sprint Planning Meeting - determine work to be tackled in next sprint.
* the Daily Stand Up - shortest and most important - each team member gives update on what they achieved, what they hope to achieve, and what if anything is blocking success.
* the Sprint Review - update on progress and demo the working iteration of the product.
* the Sprint Retrospective - an opportunity for the team to discuss together their successes and failures: how they measured up to the goal(s) they committed themselves to; and what they could do differently in the next iteration.

#### _Kanban:_
Work is broken down into small items and written on a card that gets stuck on a board. Board has different columns and the work progresses through stages (ready, in progress, ready for review) with the card moving accordingly. Number of items that can progress is strictly limited. Time to complete and item ('cycle time') is tracked.

#### _XP:_
Short for eXtreme Programming, focusses on quality of delivered software and prescribes engineering solutions toward that end. An XP teach engages in Release Planning and Iteration Planning. Work is short development cycles so changes requested by customer can be incorporated frequently.

### *Kanban vs Scrum*
- Scrum is more prescriptive, Kanban defining roles and teams and has no formal structure of meetings.
- Kanban's visual techniques make it suited to co-located teams who work on backlog of items subject to frequent change. Work in Progress rule makes it suitable for teams with limited resources or where input from every member is required on each item.
- Kanban board is often adopted by Scrum teams in the form of a task board and used to track progress throughout a sprint.
- Scrum aims to improve its output over successive sprints and to improve the 'velocity' of the team, making Scrum more suitable for scaling.

### *Scrum vs XP*
- In Scrum, teams and meetings are fairly set in stone, whereas the question of how work gets done is left to teams to decide for themselves. XP comes with a set of core practices.
- Scrum is more methodology, concerned with productivity, while XP is more engineering.
- XP practices are often added to Scrum like Pair Programming, Test Driven Development, and Refactoring.
- XP teams work on items in priority order, while Scrum might not necessarily priority order once in a sprint.
- XP can bring new items of work into an iteration and switch out time if the customer decides on a new priority.
- Role of customer in XP is similar to that of Product Owner in Scrum.
- Both mandate a daily stand-up meeting.
- Wile both stress the importance of co-location, only XP makes it deal-breaker.

### *Concluding Thoughts*
- All three adhere to Agile Manifesto which aims at providing as much value to customers as possible in time available. Differences are a result of trying to uphold Agile principals in radically different contexts.
- Kanban is useful for teams with continually changing backlog to increase efficiency by limiting the amount of work in progress, while respecting existing roles and responsibilities.
- Scrum is more suitable to teams who can devote time to a project or product. Brings more in way of structure to help teams make major productivity gains through frequent communication and planning while providing the freedom to decide among themselves how to engineer solutions. 
- XP adds another level of sophistication, focusing on quality by insisting on a set of core engineering practices which keep code clean and software stable.
