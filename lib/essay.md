# Birthplace of Aimee

Aimee was born in Providence, Rhode Island even though she lived in Rehoboth, Massachusetts at the time. She was born at the same hospital as her sisters, her mother, her nana, and her grandmother before her. The name of the hospital was Women and Infants.

## Tacos Tacos Tacos

Aimee's favorite food is tacos. She could eat them all day. Torchy's in one of her favorite taco places in Houston, but for breakfast tacos, it's El Rey all the way!
