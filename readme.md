Git To Know You

This is a git repo intended to introduce you to the basic workflow and
on-the-job tools you'll need to leverage the power of source control with git.

Our to-do list

1. Convert this file to a simple markup language called "Markdown".
2. Spell check the file at `lib/article.md`
3. Add content to `lib/essay.md` in Markdown, with two sections. The first section should open with an `h1` heading and the second should open with an `h2` heading. These are references that will make more sense once you learn more about Markdown. You should use italics, bold, strike out, an unordered list and an ordered list. The first section should be about your place of birth. The second section should be about your favorite food. Include one quote using a block quote.
